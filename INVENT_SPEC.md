Score how memorable a single video game title is. Evaluate the title's distinctiveness, compactness, rhythm, phonetic appeal, and ease of recall. A great title sticks in the mind — it is easy to remember, easy to share in conversation, and easy to search for. Titles that are overly generic should score lower because they disappear into the noise of a crowded marketplace. Titles that are too long or cumbersome should score lower because they resist being spoken aloud or recalled later. The most memorable titles tend to be distinctive without being alienating, compact without being vague, and have a sonic or visual quality that lodges in memory. A title should be able to survive in the wild — standing out on a storefront page and being findable by someone who heard it mentioned once in passing.
