1. Evaluate the distinctiveness of the title. Determine the degree to which the title occupies its own unique territory — whether it feels like it belongs to one thing and one thing only, or whether it blends into the generic noise of common game naming conventions. Titles built from overused words and familiar constructions like "Dark Quest" or "Battle Zone" should score lower because they are interchangeable with countless others. Titles that feel specific and singular — names that resist confusion with anything else — should score higher. However, a title that is so strange or impenetrable that it alienates rather than intrigues has overshot the mark. The ideal is to be recognizable and singular without being bizarre.

2. Evaluate the compactness of the title. Determine whether the title expresses its identity efficiently or whether it is burdened by unnecessary length. Every additional word and syllable works against recall — longer titles are harder to remember, harder to speak aloud, and harder to type into a search bar. Titles of one to three words that land with clarity should score well. Sprawling titles with many words or cumbersome phrasing should score lower. However, compactness is not mere brevity: a title that is extremely short but so vague it could refer to anything has achieved brevity at the cost of meaning. True compactness is compression without loss — the title is short, but it still evokes something specific and carries real identity.

3. Evaluate the sonic resonance of the title. Determine whether the title has a satisfying phonetic quality — a rhythm, musicality, or textural weight — that makes it pleasant to say and natural to recall. Human memory is deeply tied to sound, and titles that have cadence, alliteration, percussive punch, or a pleasing flow of syllables lodge in the ear more readily than those that feel flat or awkward on the tongue. A title like "Slay the Spire" sticks partly because of its rhythmic alliteration; "Dead Cells" snaps with two hard syllables; "Stardew Valley" rolls softly. The function should assess whether the title has this auditory quality that helps it be remembered not through effort but through the natural stickiness of sound.
